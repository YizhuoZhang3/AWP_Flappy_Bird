## Introduction
Flappy bird was a popular game and it's a classic 2D game which can be Implemented by Phaser 3. In this game, it contains multiple scenes such as menu scene, score scene, pause, and play scene. The game objects are re-used so every time pipe will reach the start of the screen it will get recycled at the end.
